# UI React Test



Clone/Fork the codesandbox repo

The project has been setup with React and Typescript, along with a basic fetch to a Cart api.

Using this base, the technical assignment is to create a cart page which will include:
- the ability to increase/descrease/remove the qty of items in the bag (this functionality is provided by the hook)

- a header, which includes a logo and a bag icon that has the total count
- a loading state view
- an empty state view
- the ability to increase/descrease/remove the qty of items in the bag (this functionality is provided by the hook)
- mobile first/responsiveness
- semantic elements
- accessibility attributes


Whilst this is only a sample application, it should be built in the same manner as a production application.
The goal of the task is to build a usable UI, so styling and interactions are important. You are free to use whatever libraries you want to style, however using Tailwind would be a bonus (and is already setup for you).
The UI doesn't have to match PLT's cart, as long as it looks clean - it's probably worth saving time by using some existing design.

We will be looking at:
- how clean the code is
- structure of the code
- tests (jest and react testing library are setup for you already)
- typescript usage
- the UI itself, html structure, responsiveness, accessibility etc


Please don't spend more than a few hours working on this. It does not matter if you cannot complete all the requirements, please substitute code for comments/explanation where applicable. If for some reason something doesn't work, don't worry too much about it but if you could let us know that would help!
